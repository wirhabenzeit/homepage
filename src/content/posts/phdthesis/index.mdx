## Abstract

In the first part of this thesis we consider large random matrices with arbitrary
expectation and a general slowly decaying correlation among its entries. We prove
universality of the local eigenvalue statistics and optimal local laws for the resolvent in
the bulk and edge regime. The main novel tool is a systematic diagrammatic control of
a multivariate cumulant expansion.

In the second part we consider Wigner-type matrices and show that at any cusp
singularity of the limiting eigenvalue distribution the local eigenvalue statistics are uni-
versal and form a Pearcey process. Since the density of states typically exhibits only
square root or cubic root cusp singularities, our work complements previous results on
the bulk and edge universality and it thus completes the resolution of the Wigner-
Dyson-Mehta universality conjecture for the last remaining universality type. Our
analysis holds not only for exact cusps, but approximate cusps as well, where an ex-
tended Pearcey process emerges. As a main technical ingredient we prove an optimal
local law at the cusp, and extend the fast relaxation to equilibrium of the Dyson Brow-
nian motion to the cusp regime.

In the third and final part we explore the entrywise linear statistics of Wigner ma-
trices and identify the fluctuations for a large class of test functions with little regularity.
This enables us to study the rectangular Young diagram obtained from the interlacing
eigenvalues of the random matrix and its minor, and we find that, despite having the
same limit, the fluctuations differ from those of the algebraic Young tableaux equipped
with the Plancharel measure.
