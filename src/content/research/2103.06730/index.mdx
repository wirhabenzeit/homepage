## Abstract

We consider the quadratic form of a general deterministic matrix on the eigenvectors of an $N\times N$ Wigner matrix and prove that it has Gaussian fluctuation for each bulk eigenvector in the large $N$ limit. The proof is a combination of the energy method for the Dyson Brownian motion inspired by [Marcinek, Yau 2020] and our recent multi-resolvent local laws [Cipolloni, Erdős, Schröder 2020](./201213215).
