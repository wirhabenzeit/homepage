[Observable Plot](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot) is a powerful library for exploratory data analysis, [Qwik](https://qwik.dev) is a minimalistic Javascript framework. This article shows how to render Observable Plot graphics using Qwik, on the server and on the client. The goal is two-fold:

- static rendering during build time for fast page loads, and full functionality without Javascript
- interactive rendering on the client side for progressive layout, animations, and user interaction

## Example

<Example />

## Usage

The `Chart` component has two main props: `plotFunction$` and `args`, and some optional props for controlling the rendering:

```
<Chart
    plotFunction$={T => Plot.PlotOptions}
    args={Signal<T>}
    fullWidth={boolean?}
    fullHeight={boolean?}
    aspectRatio={number?}
/>
```

Here `plotFunction$` is a function accepting an argument of an arbitrary (serializable) type `T` and returning a `Plot.PlotOptions` object[^1]. The `args` prop is a Qwik signal containing the argument of type `T`. The plot will be re-rendered whenever the argument changes[^2]. The `fullWidth` and `fullHeight` props control whether the plot should take the full width or height of the container. The `aspectRatio` prop can be used to set the aspect ratio of the plot if specifying exactly either the width or height. Note that for server-side rendering it makes sense to set set width and height explicitly, as the container size is not known.

The following example shows how to use the `Chart` component to render the plot above. Here `Select` is a component changing the value of the `colorby` and `symbolby` signals when the user selects an option.

//<Code code={exampleCode} lang="tsx" title="example.tsx" />

## Code for `Chart`

The implementation of the `Chart` component is shown below. The main ingredients are

- `JSDOM` for server side rendering, unfortunately the `document` option [^3] does not seem to work with Qwik (?)
- `ResizeObserver` for tracking the size of the container
- `useVisibleTask$` for rendering the plot when the argument signal changes, or the container is resized

//<Code code={chartCode} lang="tsx" title="plot.tsx" />

[^1]: `$` sign is used to tell the Qwik optimizer to extract the argument into a separate file which then can be loaded by both server and client code, see https://qwik.dev/docs/advanced/dollar/ for more information.

[^2]: A full rerender is triggered whenever the argument changes, which is not the most efficient way to update the plot. A more sophisticated approach would be to update only the changed parts of the plot, e.g. using the `render` transform as demonstrated in https://observablehq.com/@fil/plot-animate-a-bar-chart/2
