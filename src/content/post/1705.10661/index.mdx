## Summary

{frontmatter.description}

<br />

### Main result

The first main result asserts that the resolvent $G(z):=(H-z)^{-1}$ of an $n\times n$ random matrix $H$ with correlated entries is well approximated by the unique solution $M(z)$ to the _Matrix Dyson Equation_

$$
-M(z)^{-1} = \mathbf{E} (H-\mathbf E H) M(z) (H-\mathbf E H) + z - \mathbf E H.
$$

The second main result is that the local eigenvalue statistics of $H$ are given by the universal _Sine kernel_ statistics.

### Proof

One key ingredient for the proof is the fast relaxation to equilibrium of _Dyson Brownian motion_:

Here there are two classes of _particles_ (red and black) which initially are independent from each other. Then both particles are evolved using the same DBM and already after a short time the trajectories merge.

## Abstract

We consider large random matrices with a general slowly decaying correlation among its entries. We prove universality of the local eigenvalue statistics and optimal local laws for the resolvent away from the spectral edges, generalizing the recent result of [arXiv:1604.08188](https://arxiv.com/abs/1604.08188) to allow slow correlation decay and arbitrary expectation. The main novel tool is a systematic diagrammatic control of a multivariate cumulant expansion.
