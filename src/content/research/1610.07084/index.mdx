## Abstract

We show that matrix elements of functions of $N\times N$ Wigner matrices fluctuate on a scale of order $N^{-1/2}$ and we identify the limiting fluctuation. Our result holds for any function $f$ of the matrix that has bounded variation and thus considerably relaxes the regularity requirement imposed in [7,11].
