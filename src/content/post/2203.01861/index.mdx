## Abstract

We prove a general local law for Wigner matrices which optimally handles observables of arbitrary rank and thus it unifies the well-known averaged and isotropic local laws. As an application, we prove that the quadratic forms of a general deterministic matrix $A$ on the bulk eigenvectors of a Wigner matrix has approximately Gaussian fluctuation. For the bulk spectrum, we thus generalize our previous result [arXiv:2103.06730] valid for test matrices $A$ of large rank as well as the result of Benigni and Lopatto [arXiv:2103.12013] valid for specific small rank observables.
